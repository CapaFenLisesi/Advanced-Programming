Here are all of the problems that I used for my class! Feel free to use some of mine, but also make it your own :)

The first link is my entire compiled problem sets, but the links may break.
The following links are the problems I included. I mostly used ones already found on hackerrank, but wrote my own for some of them.

I also include notes if I had any problems with the problems. Sometimes they were problematic. I definitely reccomend solving all problems before giving them.

My custom challenges. It looks like in order to include them you need moderator priveleges, so if you send me an email to tsor1313@gmail.com, I can add you as a moderator to the questions. Alternatively, all the code and generation files are in the problem set file.

Warning: the pacman problems are very finicky in ordering for grading, watch out. I gave credit to those whose code I looked at that looked correct
